    <section class="intro">
      <p><strong>United Voices</strong> is a growing international organization dedicated to the principles of democratic world federalism. In an era defined by global challenges—climate change, conflict, inequality—we believe the solution lies not in isolation or elite-driven decision-making, but in transparent, inclusive cooperation.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to lay the foundation for a reimagined global governance system—one where power is decentralized, accountability is paramount, and ordinary people have a direct voice in shaping the future of our planet.</p>
